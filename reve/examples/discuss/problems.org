* libc
- strcasecmp
  - lookuptables are ridiculously slow
- strcat
  - unrolling
  - not that interesting
- strchr
  - unrolling in dietlibc
  - bitops in glibc
- strcmp
  - implementation in dietlibc depends on alignment
- strcpy
  - dietlibc depends on alignment
  - openbsd calls memcpy which looks crazy
- strdup
  - boring, only malloc and memcpy
- strerror
  - no clear behavior
- strlcat
  - probably works, haven’t gotten around to trying it out
- strlcpy
  - probably works, haven’t gotten around to trying it out
- strlen
  - dietlibc
    - ridiculous amount of bitops
  - glibc
    - unrolled
- strncasecmp
  - lookuptables
- strncat
  - unrolling
- strncpy
  - dietlibc & glibc call different functions
  - openbsd inlines everything
  - might work with inlining
- strnlen
  - glibc
    - inlining & unrolling
  - openbsd
    - inlining
  - dietlibc
    - calls memchr
  - openbsd & dietlibc might work with inlining
- strrchr
  - dietlibc
    - unrolling
  - dietlibc
    - calls strchr
  - glibc
    - obvious implementation
- strsep
  - glibc
    - a lot of checks and then strpbrk
  - dietlibc & openbsd
    - probably needs off by n in inner loop
- strspn
  - iirc it didn’t work, but I don’t remember why :)
- strstr
  - different
- strtok_r
  - implementations look too different (haven’t tried it :))
  - same goes for the rest of the strto* functions
