* Manual solving
- Removing the solution for INV_10 results in infinite loop
  - z3 instantly solves this
- Removing any of the other invariants results in unknown even when enabling undef
  - Removing 13 results in unsat for z3
  - Removing 12 results in infinite loop in z3
    - Disabling undef results in unsat
  - Removing 11 results in unsat
* Conclusion
wtf
